# Overview

`ddddd` is a **game night** hosted by your friend **Dave**. Like games? I want you here!

# Games?

It will vary, but `ddddd` will lean towards **tabletop RPGs**, like D&D 5e. *However*, we will play whatever sounds good to whoever can be here. Sometimes that will could be a boardgame or something weirder.

## Adventures

A typical session might be in a randomly generated dungeon or a small pre-built scenario ( sometimes referred to as a "one-shot" ). We will avoid the long intricately-plotted campaigns - not because we don't like them, but because they don't as easily support dropping in and out.

I'm interested in trying different games and systems, including, but not limited to: D&D, Mouseguard RPG, One-Page RPGs, HeroQuest, Fiasco, Mansions of Madness, Pathfinder and anything else we can find.

# When

The goal is for `ddddd` to be very low commitment. It is an "open table" format, meaning you can drop in and out and not miss anything. Show up when you can and don't feel bad when you can't.

## Scheduling

I'll coordinate the night **approximately monthly** by either: a) just picking a night, or b) sending out a calendar poll to see what works for the most people.

The best sessions are around 3 to 4 hours. Sometimes we will be able to do that on a weekend. Shorter sessions of 1 to 3 hours are also do-able and might fall on weeknights instead.

Getting together for a shorter time **beats** not getting together at all.

# Preparation

## What should you bring?

**Nothing!** Just be here. That's it. ( Bring dice, characters sheets, books, or miniatures only if you feel like it. )

## Dave's commitment to you

- I'll have a game, dungeon, or scenario ready to play. Possibly more than one option to choose from.
- I'll have pre-generated characters if you don't want to roll your own.
- I'll have dice, pencils, and paper.
- I'll have at least one snack and at least one kind of beer.

# What's the big idea?

## Some gaming is better than none

It's very difficult to find time to game. Everyone is busy and can't commit to a large number of sessions. Every potential time is going to not work for someone. Just game when you can with whom you can.

## Try new things

I've never been a GM before. I've never played several of the games in my game cabinet. I've never hosted a game night on a regular basis. I've never tried some of these weird games I've found freely online.

## Be intentional

Make an effort to create the time and space to do the things I want to do. Don't let life pass me by.
